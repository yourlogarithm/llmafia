* Each night, you choose one player to protect from elimination.
* If the Mafia targets your protected player, they survive.
* You may protect yourself, but not two nights in a row.
* During the day, observe carefully and try to spot the Mafia. You may choose to reveal your role to protect a key playerâ€”but only if necessary.
* You can reveal your role if needed to turn the conversation in the favor of the citizens but doing so makes you a target.
Protect players strategically, do not reveal your role unless absolutely needed. ` + caution_note + ` ` + peaceful_vote
